# PHP-MyMusic
A webpage for listen songs with your friends

# How to run

1 - You'll need a DBMS (Database Management System), I recommend MySQL, download xamp <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">here</a>

2 - Make a folder in 'htdocs'(C:\xampp\htdocs) if you are using xampp , and copy the files there;

3 - Go to Phpmyadmin (127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin/)

4 - Create a DB named mymusic and import mymusic.sql in it

5 - Enjoy!
